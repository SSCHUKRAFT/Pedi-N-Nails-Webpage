# Webpage Developed for Pedi N Nails
I was contracted by the nail company to develop a modern and responsive webpage for their busniess needs.

## How I developed the webpage
I utilized various React with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML components to ensure the project was fast and consistent.

## How to run the application
You must have React, React Scripts, React-DOM, Material-UI, and Material-UI Icons installed before you run the program.
For more information, follow these links:
[React](https://reactjs.org/)
[Material-UI](https://mui.com/)

After everything is installed, enter the folowing commands:
`cd pedi-n-nails`
`npm start`

## Credits
This web-application was developed solely by me.
