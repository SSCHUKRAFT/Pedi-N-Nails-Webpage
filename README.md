# Webpage Developed for Pedi N Nails
I was contracted by the nail company to develop a modern and responsive webpage for their busniess needs.

## How I developed the webpage
I utilized various React with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML components to ensure the project was fast and consistent.

## How to run the application
You must have React, React Scripts, React-DOM, Material-UI, and Material-UI Icons installed before you run the program.<br />
For more information, follow these links:<br />

`npm start`<br />
